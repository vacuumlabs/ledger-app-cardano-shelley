## Compilation

In `fuzzing` folder

```
cmake -DBOLOS_SDK=/path/to/sdk -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang -Bbuild -H.
```

then

```
make -C build
```

Harnesses built:
```
all_harness
deriveAddress_harness
deriveNativeScriptHash_harness
getPublicKeys_harness
signCVote_harness
signMsg_harness
signOpCert_harness
signTx_harness
```

## Run

To start fuzzing simply do `./build/<harness>` where `<harness>` is one of the files above. For instance

```
./build/deriveAddress_harness
```

Since there is an already existing corpus, to start fuzzing with it simply do `./build/<harness> ./corpus`
