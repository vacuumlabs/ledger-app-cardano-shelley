# Derive Address

Derive a Shelley address (including legacy Byron addresses) and either return it, or show it to the user for confirmation.

The supported address types are given in the definition of `address_type_t` in [src/addressUtilsShelley.c](../src/addressUtilsShelley.c).

The derivation scheme is BIP44 for Byron `v2` addresses and an analogous scheme (using `1852'` instead of `44'` in the derivation path) for the new Shelley addresses. Most Shelley addresses also contain staking info. See `parseAddressParams` in [src/addressUtilsShelley.c](../src/addressUtilsShelley.c) for the description of additional address parameters.

We expect this call to be used for the address verification purposes (i.e., matching address on Ledger with the one on the screen).

Note: Unlike BTC Ledger app which returns both public key and the corresponding address in the same instruction call, we split these two functionalities as they serve different purposes. Notably:
- `DeriveAddress` is weaker than `GetPublicKeys` (an extended public key allows deriving non-hardened child keys; an address does not, since it only contains hashes of public keys). As such, (in the future) the app might apply more restrictions/user confirmations to get the public key.
- `GetAddress` is typically called only for the purpose of address verification. As such, it should belong to a valid address BIP32 path.
- Note that implementations would typically call `GetAddress` with `P1_DISPLAY` to display the address to the user and `P1_RETURN` is usually not needed because the wallet anyway requested account's extended public key which enables it to derive all addresses. `P1_RETURN` can be used by paranoid users that do not want to expose account public key to the host yet they still want to be able to export individual addresses.

**Command**

| Field | Value                   |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| CLA   | `0xD7`                  |
| INS   | `0x11`                  |
| P1    | request type: `P1_RETURN=0x01` for returning address to host, `P1_DISPLAY=0x02` for displaying address on the screen |
| P2    | unused                  |
| Lc    | variable                |

**Response**

| Field   | Length   |
| ------- | -------- |
| address | variable |

Where `address` is encoded in raw bytes (i.e. no base58 or bech32 encoding).

**Ledger responsibilities**

- The input gives address parameters which fully determine the address, including the staking information needed for most Shelley address types. See `parseAddressParams` in [src/addressUtilsShelley.c](../src/addressUtilsShelley.c) for the description of this variable-length entity.
- Restrictions on these parameters are given in `policyForReturnDeriveAddress`/`policyForShowDeriveAddress` in [src/securityPolicy.c](../src/securityPolicy.c) for details.
- If the request is to show the address, Ledger should wait before sending response. Note that until user confirms the address, Ledger should not process any subsequent instruction call.
