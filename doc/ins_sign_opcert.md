# Sign Operational Certificate

**Description**

Get a signature for a given operational certificate and a cold key path.

The signing algorithm is the same as for transaction witnesses.

The key derivation scheme for pool cold keys is described in [CIP 1853 - HD Stake Pool Cold Keys for Cardano](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip1853/).
