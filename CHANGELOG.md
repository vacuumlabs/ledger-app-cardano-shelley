## [6.1.2](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-cardano/compare/v5.0.0...LedgerHQ:nanos_2.1.0_6.1.2_sdk_2.1.0-12) - [October 25th 2023]

- multidelegation allowed (as used by Lace, i.e. stake keys do not need to end with 0 as address_index)


## [5.0.0](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-cardano/compare/4.1.2...LedgerHQ:nanos_2.1.0_5.0.0) - [October 11th 2022]

Expert mode and token decimal places

### Added

### Changed

- required signers are now allowed in ordinary and multisig transactions

- pool registration transaction witness must be consistent with the path of the owner (for `SIGN_TX_SIGNINGMODE_POOL_REGISTRATION_OWNER`)
- wrong pool retirement epoch UI text


## [3.0.0](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-cardano/compare/2.4.1...LedgerHQ:3.0.0) - [October 8th 2021]

Script elements in transactions and support for native scripts

### Added

- support for multisig key derivation as described in [CIP 1854 - Multi-signatures HD Wallets](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip1854/)

- support for address types with script hashes (all Shelley address types are now supported)
- support for script elements in transactions (certficates etc.) within a new transaction signing mode
- validation of canonical ordering of cbor map keys (withdrawals, token policy ids in outputs and mint, asset names within an asset group)

### Changed

- serialization of certain APDU messages breaks backwards compatibility (mostly because paths were replaced with stake credentials)
- the limit on number of witnesses based on transaction body elements has been dropped


### Fixed

- public keys are now displayed in bech32 instead of hex strings
- certain assertions have been turned into proper validations


## [2.4.1](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-cardano/compare/2.3.2...LedgerHQ:2.4.1) - [June 29th 2021]

Support for signing pool registrations by operators.

### Added

- operational certificate signing

- support for pool retirement certificates in ordinary transactions

### Changed

- public key derivation extended with pool cold key derivation, as described in [CIP 1853 - HD Stake Pool Cold Keys for Cardano](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip1853/)
- pool registration transactions have reworked APDU flow (not compatible with older version of the js library), but ordinary transactions are backwards-compatible

### Fixed

- Fixed pool id still being displayed as hex for stake delegations instead of bech32: https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledger-app-cardano-shelley/pull/53#issuecomment-821971545


## [2.3.2](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-cardano/compare/2.2.1...LedgerHQ:2.3.2) - [May 10th 2021]

## [2.2.1](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-cardano/compare/2.2.0...LedgerHQ:2.2.1) - [March 30th 2021]

Minor release updating the way of showing multiasset identifiers. No API changes.

### Added

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-cardano/compare/2.1.0...LedgerHQ:2.2.0) - [February 15th 2021]

### Added

- Support for Allegra-era transaction validity interval start property and transaction outputs containing native assets (Mary-era): https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledger-app-cardano-shelley/pull/54

 
### Changed

- Transaction TTL is now optional, complying with Allegra hard-fork changes: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-cardano/pull/6/files
- Stake pool ID displayed as bech32 instead of hex, complying with [CIP0005](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0005/CIP-0005.md): https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-cardano/pull/6/files

### Fixed
